# Nerds Timeline: Star Wars

Welcome to the **Nerds Timeline: Star Wars** repository! This project aims to create a comprehensive timeline of all Star Wars media, including books, movies, TV shows, and more. 

## Purpose

As a major Star Wars nerd, I have always been on the lookout for a comprehensive timeline of Star Wars media that shows the order in which things were released as well as their chronological order within the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, I have never been able to find "one timeline to rule them all." This repository is my attempt to create that ultimate timeline.

## Goals

- Compile a complete timeline of all Star Wars media.
- Provide both release order and chronological order.
- Allow filtering by media type
- Include detailed information about each entry, such as release date, timeline placement, and any relevant notes.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any information that can help make this timeline more complete or accurate, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

May the Force be with you!
